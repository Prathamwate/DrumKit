# Drum kit App

Welcome to the Sound Buttons App repository! This web application provides an interactive experience where users can trigger different sounds using both keyboard keys and mouse clicks. The app features a single main title and 7 buttons, each associated with a unique sound.

## Features

- One H1 tag serving as the main title.
- 7 buttons, each representing a different sound.
- Buttons are contained within a flex container with properties `display: flex` and `flex-wrap: wrap`.
- Font formatting changes accomplished through `font-size` and `font-family` CSS properties.
- Utilization of a switch-case structure to handle different sounds based on user input.
- Event listeners capture keyboard key presses and execute corresponding functions, extracting the pressed key using `event.key`.
- `onclick` property implementation for passing the `keyvalue` upon mouse click.
